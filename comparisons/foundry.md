### **Relationships Between Agents, Runs, and Conversations**

1. **Agents and Runs**:
   - Agents are responsible for executing **runs**, which represent tasks or operations performed by the agent.
   - A **run** includes inputs (e.g., user messages) and outputs (e.g., agent responses).
   - Runs can be associated with an agent using the `agentId` property in `RunInputs`.

2. **Conversations and Runs**:
   - Conversations provide a context for runs by organizing messages exchanged between the user and the agent.
   - A **conversationId** can be passed in `RunInputs` to associate a run with an existing conversation.
   - Outputs from a run (e.g., agent responses) are added as messages to the associated conversation.

3. **Conversations and Agents**:
   - Agents interact with users through conversations, where the agent's responses are recorded as messages.
   - Conversations maintain the context of interactions, enabling agents to generate context-aware responses during runs.

### **Summary**
- **Agents** execute tasks through **runs**, which process inputs and generate outputs.
- **Conversations** organize interactions between users and agents, providing context for runs.
- Runs can be linked to conversations, ensuring continuity and context in user-agent interactions.
