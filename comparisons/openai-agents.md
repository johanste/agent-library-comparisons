### **Nouns (Entities)**

1. **Agent**:
   - Represents an LLM equipped with instructions and tools.
   - Properties:
     - Can perform tasks autonomously using tools and instructions.
     - Supports delegation through handoffs to other agents.
     - Includes built-in guardrails for input validation.

2. **Runner**:
   - Executes agents and manages their lifecycle.
   - Properties:
     - Handles agent loops, including calling tools and sending results to the LLM.
     - Manages the iterative process until the task is complete.

3. **Tool**:
   - A Python function that an agent can invoke to perform specific tasks.
   - Properties:
     - Automatically generates schemas for input validation.
     - Supports Pydantic-powered validation for robust error handling.

4. **Handoff**:
   - A mechanism for delegating tasks between agents.
   - Properties:
     - Allows agents to collaborate by passing tasks to other agents.
     - Enables coordination in multi-agent workflows.

5. **Guardrail**:
   - A validation mechanism for agent inputs and outputs.
   - Properties:
     - Runs checks in parallel with agent operations.
     - Breaks execution early if validation fails.

6. **Tracing**:
   - A built-in feature for visualizing and debugging workflows.
   - Properties:
     - Tracks agent operations, tool invocations, and handoffs.
     - Supports evaluation, fine-tuning, and monitoring of workflows.

7. **Function Schema**:
   - A schema defining the inputs and outputs of a tool.
   - Properties:
     - Ensures compatibility between tools and agents.
     - Facilitates seamless integration of Python functions as tools.

8. **Pipeline**:
   - Represents a sequence of tasks or operations in a workflow.
   - Properties:
     - Manages inputs, intermediate results, and final outputs.
     - Supports event-driven execution and error handling.

9. **Event**:
   - Represents triggers or actions within a pipeline or workflow.
   - Properties:
     - Initiates specific operations or transitions.
     - Enables dynamic responses to changes in the workflow.

10. **Result**:
    - The final output of an agent or pipeline.
    - Properties:
      - Includes the processed data or response generated by the agent.
      - Tracks the completion status of the workflow.

### **Verbs (Actions)**

1. **Initialize Agent**:
   - Creates and configures an agent with instructions and tools.
   - Includes setting up guardrails and handoff mechanisms.

2. **Run Agent**:
   - Executes an agent using the `Runner`.
   - Manages the agent loop, including tool invocations and result processing.

3. **Invoke Tool**:
   - Calls a Python function registered as a tool.
   - Validates inputs using the function schema and Pydantic.

4. **Delegate Task**:
   - Passes a task to another agent using handoffs.
   - Enables collaboration between multiple agents.

5. **Validate Input**:
   - Runs guardrails to check the validity of inputs.
   - Ensures that invalid inputs are caught before execution.

6. **Trace Workflow**:
   - Tracks the execution of agents, tools, and handoffs.
   - Provides debugging and monitoring capabilities.

7. **Generate Schema**:
   - Creates a schema for a Python function to be used as a tool.
   - Ensures compatibility with agent workflows.

8. **Execute Pipeline**:
   - Runs a sequence of tasks or operations in a workflow.
   - Manages inputs, intermediate results, and final outputs.

9. **Trigger Event**:
   - Initiates specific actions or transitions in a pipeline.
   - Responds dynamically to changes in the workflow.

10. **Return Result**:
    - Outputs the final result of an agent or pipeline.
    - Summarizes the completion status and processed data.

### **Key Relationships**
- **Agents and Tools**:
  - Agents use tools to perform specific tasks.
  - Tools are Python functions with schemas for input validation.

- **Agents and Handoffs**:
  - Handoffs enable agents to delegate tasks to other agents.
  - Facilitates collaboration in multi-agent workflows.

- **Agents and Guardrails**:
  - Guardrails validate inputs and outputs for agents.
  - Ensures robust and error-free execution.

- **Pipelines and Events**:
  - Pipelines manage sequences of tasks, triggered by events.
  - Events enable dynamic and adaptive workflows.

- **Tracing and Workflows**:
  - Tracing provides visibility into agent operations and workflows.
  - Supports debugging, evaluation, and fine-tuning of agents.
